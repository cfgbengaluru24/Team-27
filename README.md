# Team-27 JPMC Project: Lantana Removal and Circular Green Economy ðŸŒ¿

## Problem Statement
The Shola Trust has identified Lantana camara's invasion as a significant threat causing biodiversity loss and human-wildlife conflicts. They seek innovative, scalable removal strategies.

## Our Solution
We propose a circular green economy integrating Lantana removal, forest restoration, and habitat improvement. This includes converting Lantana into valuable products like furniture, crafts, composite boards, fuelwood substitutes, and biochar. Our solution aims for scalable ecosystem management and economic development through sustainable livelihoods for indigenous communities.
